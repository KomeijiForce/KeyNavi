# Correlation and Navigation in the Vocabulary Key Representation Space of Language Models [[üìÉPaper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02284)

Some knowledge is memorized by LLMs, but you cannot prompt to get it - we provide a simple we to do so. Here's why and how.

1) Neural LMs suffer from spurious correlations in next-token prediction (NTP), where mid-ranked tokens are biased toward distributionally similar but incorrect options, reducing sampling diversity.

2) We propose an iterative in-context method (ICN) that updates the query representation by including explored decoding results, pushing the LM away from previously selected tokens.

3) ICN improves generation diversity and self-consistency in knowledge probing, open-ended generation, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

You can check the illustration of vocabulary representation clusters in Huggingface for [llama-3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KomeijiForce/llama3_vocabulary_cluster) and [olmo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KomeijiForce/olmo_vocabulary_cluster). Some cluster examples are illustrated above.

### Spurious Key Correlation

In ```Spurious_Key_Correlation.ipynb```, we provide a pipeline to show how the next tokens predicted from different clusters from the top predictions are more accurate.
